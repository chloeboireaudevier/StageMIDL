   'sentence_en': 'No worries, I'm here to help you! 😺\nWhen you look at a Tv or Pv diagram, the transition between liquid and vapor is manifested by the boiling and dew curves.\nOn these diagrams, how do you think the different phases (liquid, vapor, and mixture) are represented?\nThe critical point is the moment when the distinction between liquid and vapor disappears.\nCan you imagine why this is important for thermodynamic applications, such as in thermal power plants?\nThis deviation represents a deviation from ideal conditions.\nHow would it be crucial to know this deviation when analyzing the performance of thermodynamic systems?\nThink about these points, it could clarify your ideas! 💡😊'}
